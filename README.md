# Flower Classification with ResNet-50

## This project involves building and training a ResNet-50 model to classify flower images into various categories. The project includes two main scripts:

`main.py`: The initial, more comprehensive implementation for training the ResNet-50 model.
`light.py`: An optimized and efficient version of the training script that uses a subset of data and includes early stopping.
